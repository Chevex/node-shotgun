ShotgunShell
============

Shotgun Shell is a UI agnostic command-line framework. It allows you to quickly and easily write commands and plug them into the framework. Rather than assuming an interface, such as the Javascript console, Shotgun Shell returns a JSON result that acts as a set of instructions so that any UI can easily be built to consume it.
